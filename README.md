### After many deep dives I've found myself in possession of many hats, like Frontend / Backend Software Engineer, Recording / Performing Musician, and Teacher.

### Where I'm at:
- 🛠️ I’m currently working on finishing up several solo full stack web apps, and looking to collaborate on more web app projects
- 📚 I’m currently learning full stack web development with an emphasis on React / Redux frontend
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on any music / music education or other arts-related projects (other project spaces are welcome too 🤠)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with GraphQL and other database query languages/frameworks to further my understanding of data management and relationships
- 💬 Ask me about the parallels and patterns between programming and music
- 📫 How to reach me: [EMAIL](jlauxman@gmail.com)  ||  [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-lauxman-a3170b261/) 
- 😸 Fun fact: Proud Cat Dad

### A little bit more about me:

*I’ve been a performing musician and music instructor for the last 10+ years, and have now dove deep into the software development field after the recommendation from some like-minded and well regarded musicians and friends within my circles. I’ve noted and grown to love the parallels between programming and music as languages with varying ‘dialects’ as well as the use of theory/methods and inner working logic used to organically produce unique creative endeavors. After spending the past half a year or more focusing on Javascript, Python, React.js / Redux.js, Flask, HTML5 / CSS3 and applying said languages to several solo and group full stack web projects, I’m ready to head into the next venture of coding and further the depths of my skills. I am looking for the opportunity to expand my overall knowledge in the field while still given ample opportunity to apply and hone my current abilities. I'd love to contribute to any organized and supportive team developing intuitive and well thought projects, especially those related to music, the arts or educational spaces.*
