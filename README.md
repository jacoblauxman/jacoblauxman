### I'm a Software Engineer, Musician, and Teacher.

### Where I'm at:
- 🛠️ I’m currently working on finishing up several solo full stack web apps, and looking to collaborate on more projects
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on any music / music education or other arts-related projects (other project spaces are welcome too 🤠)
- 💬 Ask me about the parallels and patterns between programming and music
- 📫 How to reach me: [EMAIL](mailto:jlauxman@gmail.com)  ||  [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-lauxman-a3170b261/) 
- 😸 Fun fact: Proud Cat Dad

### A little bit more about me:

*I’m a Software Engineer with 10+ years experience as a performing musician and music instructor. I’ve noted and grown to love the parallels between programming and music as languages with varying ‘dialects’ as well as the use of theory/methods and inner working logic used to organically produce unique creative endeavors. After spending the past half a year or more focusing on Javascript, Python, React.js / Redux.js, Flask, HTML5 / CSS3 and applying said languages to several solo and group full stack web projects, I’m ready to head into the next venture of coding and further the depths of my skills. I am looking for the opportunity to expand my overall knowledge in the field while still given ample opportunity to apply and hone my current abilities. I'd love to contribute to any organized and supportive team developing intuitive and well thought projects, especially those related to music, the arts or educational spaces.*
